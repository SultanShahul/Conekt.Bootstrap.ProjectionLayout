# Orchard Projection Layouts

This module adds a new type of layout to the Projections feature, _Carousel Layout_.

## Carousel Layout

This layout creates the HTML markup for use with the Twitter Boostrap Carousel.

## Thanks

Thanks to Steve Taylor for producing the article "Image Carousel using Twitter Bootstrap and Orchard CMS Projections".
The article does not provide any source material so this module is based on the projection layout structure from his article seen here: http://www.stevetaylor.me.uk/image-carousel-using-twitter-bootstrap-and-orchard-cms-projections.
